1. Time complexity : it is the amount of time taken by the algorithm to run
                : as a function of the length of input 
    why : for better programs
        : comparision of algorithm
        Notation: Big (O) Notation
                : Theta (Q)
                : Omega (Omega)
    complexity:O(1)<O(log N)<O(N)<O(N log N)<O(N^2)<O(N^3)<O(2^N)<O(N!)
2. Space complexity : space require by the varibale
            eg : int a =1 , b = 2 , c = 3 , d = 4 , e = 5 , f = 6 
                    above the space complexity is O(1) because it is constant 
            eg : int arr[5] =  {1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11}
                    above the space complexity is O(1) because it is constant 5 length of array
